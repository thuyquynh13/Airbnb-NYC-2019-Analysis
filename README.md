Suppose that you are working as a data analyst at Airbnb. For the past few months in Covid time, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue. When the restrictions have been lifted and people have started to travel more, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.

In order to increase the revenue, the different leaders at Airbnb want to understand some important insights based on various attributes in the dataset such as:
1. Which type of hosts acquire more and where?
2. The categorisation of customers based on their preferences.
3. What are the neighbourhoods they need to target?
4. What is the pricing ranges prefered by customers?
5. The various kinds of properties that exist w.r.t customer preferences.
6. Adjustments in the existing properties to make it more customer-oriented.
7. What are the most popular localities and properties in New York currently?
8. How to get unpopular properties more traction?
